### Hello üëã I'm Mark Edward

As a research officer at the [Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR)](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/), Singapore, my work sits at the intersection of computer science and biology, with a focus on developing novel AI tools for processing and analyzing large (gigapixel-scale), multi-channel microscope images.

I was a recipient of the Br. Andrew Gonzalez FSC Award for Outstanding Research (2025) from De La Salle University, Singapore International Pre-Graduate Award (2024) from A*STAR, and Magsaysay Future Engineers/Technologists Award ‚Äì Second Prize (2023) from the National Academy of Science and Technology, Philippines.

Prior to joining A*STAR, I served as a data science consultant at the [Asian Development Bank's](https://www.adb.org/) Economic Research and Development Impact Department. I obtained my master's degree in computer science from De La Salle University, Manila, under its integrated bachelor's-master's degree honors program.

Here are some of my software engineering projects:
- üåæ [**RicePilaf**](https://github.com/bioinfodlsu/rice-pilaf). Web dashboard and novel bioinformatics pipeline for analyzing rice genomes. Published in [*GigaScience*](https://doi.org/10.1093/gigascience/giae013) and developed with the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). Written in Python and R, uses Dash and Flask as framework, and containerized via Docker
- üé® [**Artemis**](https://github.com/memgonzales/artemis-art-app). Art-sharing Android app where the community of users can post, bookmark, and provide feedback on members' works, as well as share these artworks on their Facebook accounts. Written in Kotlin and uses Firebase
- ‚õΩ [**Powerzone Inventory**](https://github.com/memgonzales/powerzone-inventory). Web-based inventory, transaction, and delivery management system for a fuel company in Bicol, Philippines. Built with MongoDB, Express.js, and Node.js and includes a CI/CD pipeline

Beyond my professional interests, I am committed to strengthening tech education. I contribute questions to the [International Bebras Challenge on Informatics and Computational Thinking](https://www.bebras.org/), an annual contest joined by over 4 million students from 70 countries. My 2023 problem proposal was awarded Best Task, and my 2022 and 2024 proposals were nominated for this recognition.
